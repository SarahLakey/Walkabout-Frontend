# Walkabout-Backend 2.0
#### *Note:* This project is a refactored version the original Walkabout the Gateway application:
- using different tech stack
- improving previous glitches
- gaining hands-on experiencing writing code for every component 
*(in contrast - in the original application, our group split up developing responsibilities)*


The goal of this project is to implement an online step tracker platform to satiate users’ curiosity about St. Louis while incentivizing walking for fitness or leisure. Our group found that current step trackers are missing features that could improve engagement and user experience so we developed a fake user to showcase how this can help people make healthier habits with this gamified approach. This platform provides a way to build a community by encouraging communication and interaction among neighbors and tourists in your area.

## Tech Stack:
- **Java and Spring**:
    - Backend development for maintainability, scalability, and security.


- **React**:
    - Frontend development to enhance clientside interactivity, enable component-based architecture, and improve development efficiency with reusable UI components and state management.
    - React's virtual DOM also offers a more dynamic and responsive user experience.


- **MySQL**:
    - Relational database that offers reliability, performance, and scalability.
    - Experience points and walking data stored in MySQL database.
    - Users can create, read, update, and delete journal entries about the specific areas they’ve walked.


<!-- - **API**:
    - *Coming soon* -->

## Key Features:

- **User account creation requirement**:
    - Users can create and manage an account.
    - Authentication filter for users and nonusers to access different parts of the website.


- **Full CRUD Functionality**:
    - Users can create, read, update, and delete journal entries about the specific areas they’ve walked.


- **Relational Database**:
  - Experience points stored in MySQL database.


<!-- - **External API Usage**:
    - *Coming soon* -->






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
